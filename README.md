Rules:
- Create words out of the 7 letters
- Words must be at least 4 letters long
- Words must include the center letter (highlighted blue)

Scoring: 
- 4 letter words are worth 1 point
- Words longer than 4 letters are worth 1 point per letter (eg, 6 letter word = 6 points)

Game Modes:
- There's a new game everyday that resets at midnight EST. I hand pick the letters for daily games.
- Previous games are saved and able to be played at a later date
- Randomized game will give you 7 letters that are completely randomly generated. It may take a few attempts to get a game with good letters since it is completely random and there's a chance that there are bad letters (only restraint in random generation is that if there is a 'q', then there also must be a 'u')

Future Updates:
- Change the letter generation of the randomized mode to give letters different likelihoods of being chosen.
  Letters like 's' and 'e' will have increased chances, as well as groups of letters like 'ing', 'er', and 'ed' to make games more fun
- Custom game mode where you can select the letters you want to use
- Share game with friends button will let you share your stats for the daily game with friends
